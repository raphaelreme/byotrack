    It wraps the TRA/DET/SEG softwares that are distributed at https://celltrackingchallenge.net/evaluation-methodology
    It is up to the user to download the correct executable and ensure that it works.

    To compute a metric, the code creates a temporary folder, where it saves the ground-truth tracks
    alongside the predicted tracks. Then it runs the required CTC software, and finally remove the
    temporary folder. See `CTCSoftwareRunner`.

    Note:
        This code requires CTC softwares as extra dependencies.
        They can be downloaded at https://celltrackingchallenge.net/evaluation-methodology.

    We provide two distincts methods to evaluate the metrics. One based on tracks, the other on detections:

    1. `compute_detection_metrics` compute the DET and SEG using the results of a segmentation algorithm (no tracks
    information is required). Note that TRA cannot be computed in this case.
    2. `compute_tracking_metrics` compute the metrics for tracks. One can compute the DET and SEG for the tracks,
    but these will not match with the ones computed for detections. Indeed, tracks filter out some detections
    and may add points to tracks to fill missing detections. Usually, this leads to better DET/SEG metrics
    as it reduces false positive and false negative.

    It will store the logs of the last called metric in `self.last_log`
