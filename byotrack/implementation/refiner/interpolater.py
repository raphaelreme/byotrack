class ForwardBackwardInterpolater(byotrack.Refiner):  # pylint: disable=too-few-public-methods
    """Interpolate tracks to fill out NaN values by averaging a forward estimation and a backward estimation.

    We propose three modes for position propagation: constant, tps and flow. Constant estimation propagates the
    last known position, tps interpolates elastically the motion of the active tracks to fill missing ones and
    flow uses optical flow to propagate the tracks.

    Forward and backward propagation are smoothly merged together in a weighted average. See `propagation` module

    Attributes:
        method (str | DirectedPropagate): Method to use for position propagation. Either "constant", "tps"
            or "flow" (see `constant_directed_propagate`, `tps_directed_propagate` or `optical_flow_directed_propagate`)
            or a user defined Callable following the `DirectedPropagate` protocol.
            The method will be called with the tracks_matrix, video, a boolean direction and additional kwargs.
        full (bool): If True, it will extrapolate positions for all the frames of the video
            If False, it will only interpolate NaN values inside each track domain, without extrapolation
            Default: False
        kwargs (Dict[str, Any]): Additional parameters given to `method`.
            For instance for "tps", you can set `alpha` (float) which is the regularization parameter of the
            interpolation (see `tps_propation` module and `torch_tps` librarie). We advise to use alpha > 5.0
            (alpha = 10 by default). For "flow" propagation, you should provide `optflow` (byotrack.OpticalFlow)
            to correctly estimate optical flows.
