    individual neurons in behaving animals”, PLoS computational biology, vol. 17, pp. e1009432, 10 2021.

    Attributes:
        method (str | DirectedPropagate): Method to use for position propagation. Either "constant", "tps"
            or "flow" (see `constant_directed_propagate`, `tps_directed_propagate` or `optical_flow_directed_propagate`)
            or a user defined Callable following the `DirectedPropagate` protocol.
            Default: "tps"
        eta (float): Soft threshold in LAP solving (See `DistStitcher`)
            Default: 5.0 (Pixels)
        kwargs (Dict[str, Any]): Additional parameters given to `method`.
            For instance for "tps", you can set `alpha` (float) which is the regularization parameter of the
            interpolation (see `tps_propation` module and `torch_tps` librarie). We advise to use alpha > 5.0
            (alpha = 10 by default). For "flow" propagation, you should provide `optflow` (byotrack.OpticalFlow)
            to correctly estimate optical flows.
        max_overlap (int): Cannot stitch tracks that overlap more than `max_overlap`
            Default: 5
        max_dist (float): Cannot stich track i and track j if the last position of i and
            first position of j are farther than `max_dist` (ignored if max_dist <= 0)
            Default: 100.0
        max_gap (int): Cannot stich track i and track j if i ended more
            than `max_gap` frame before j started (ignored if max_gap <= 0)
            Default: 250
