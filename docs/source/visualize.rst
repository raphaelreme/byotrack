ByoTrack ViZ
============

We add some visualization tools. They rely on matplotlib and opencv-python.

.. note:: We developed these tools under linux using opencv + gtk backend. It seems that the zoom/drag/quit operations are not automatically supported on other platforms.

.. automodule:: byotrack.visualize
