# Byotrack

Unified python API for biological particle tracking.

Many bioimage informatics tools already implement their own tracking tools (Icy, ImageJ, TrackMate...) but most of them are implemented in Java which makes it difficult for non-Java developers to experiment with the code. It is also difficult to integrate deep learning algorithms (mainly developed in Python) into these software.

We provide a unified python API for tracking that can be easily extended with new (and old) algorithms. We also provide implementations of well-known algorithms following our API.

Overview:
* Video
    * Able to read classical format (supported by opencv) + tiff
* Particle Tracking
    * MultiStepTracker (Detect / Link / Refine)
* Particle Detections
    * Spot Detector [2] (Similar as the one in Icy [1] but coded in pytorch)
    * Stardist [3] (In coming...)
* Particle Linking
    * EMHT [4] (Wrapper to the one implemented in Icy [1], requires Icy to be installed)
* Tracks Refining
    * Cleaning (In coming...)
    * EMC2 [5]: Track stitching (gap closing) (In coming...)
